# Pipe_in_C
A little experminet with C and process
The program is equivalent to using a pipe in the terminal to run to process e.g. cat file | wc -c


To Run the Program:
    1) Use -p- to seperate the two process ./marker ls File -p- wc -c
    2) Write the frist command in test.in 
    
The output will be in the test.out file
Each of the two commands are checked for errors and the error checking is found in test.err1 and test.err2
