# Pipe_in_C
A little experminet with C 

The program is equivalent to using a pipe e.g. cat file | wc -c


To Run the Program:
    1) Use -p- to seperate the two process ./marker ls File -p- wc -c or
    2) Write the first command in test.in 
    
The output will be in the test.out file
Each of the two commands are checked for errors and the error checking is found in test.err1 and test.err2
